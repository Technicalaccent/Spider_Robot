# Spider Robot Master


What Is a "Spider Robot?"

	As its name defines it, our robot is a basic representation of the sipder movements but it will not perform exactly the same body moves since we are using only four legs instead of eight legs.

	Named also a Quadrupedrobot since it has four legs and make its movements using these legs, the movment of each leg is related to the other legs in order to identify the roboty body postion and also to control the robot body balance.

	Legged robots handle terrain better than their wheeled counterparts and move in varied and animalistic ways. However, this makes legged robots more complicated, and less accessible to many makers. and also the making cost and the high depenses that a maker should spend in order to create a full body quadruped since it is based on servo motors or stepper motors and both are more expensive than DC motors that could be used in wheeled robots.


Advantages

	You will find quadrupeds abundant in nature, because four legs allow for passive stability, or the ability to stay standing without actively adjusting position. The same is true of robots. A four-legged robot is cheaper and simpler than a robot with more legs, yet it can still achieve stability.
